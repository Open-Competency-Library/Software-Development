A developer who can design logical solutions through fake code in plain english prose.

## Master the following skills:

- Discuss the purpose, benefits and use cases of pseudocode.
- Describe solutions to logical problems with plain english prose (aka "pseudocode").
- Communicate program execution and logic to developers and stakeholders using pseudocode.
- Plan linear sequences of logic using the following scenarios in pseudocode:
  - Display information for a user to see (output).
  - Request information from the user (input).
  - Assign values (words, phrases, numbers, user input, etc) to algebraic containers (aka "variables").
  - Calculate new values using values that are already available (variables, user input, etc).
  - Repeat groups of steps while a condition exists.
  - Control the flow of logic along various branches with conditional statements.
  - Repeat groups of steps until a condition exists.
  - Repeat groups of steps for each item in a list.
  - Invoke external processes to handle more complicated or involved calculations or tasks.
  - Handle situations where things go wrong ("exceptional" behavior).
- Adhere to popular pseudocode formatting standards to improve readability (indentation, capitalization, etc).
